P0:
* 3D volumetric + isosurface isnt aligned right
* L2 velocity doesnt work at all

P1:
* L3 real time fails to decode NCR and similar (`Error #01: Unsupported product code 30938`)

P2:
* L3 archive needs a better data source (GCS archive is incomplete and annoying AF to work with)
* L3 real time needs color maps for more things
* maybe show nice timestamps instead of filenames?
* more L2 products
